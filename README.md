- [ ] Setup a Mongo instance in mLab and connect to it from Node
- [ ] Deploy Client app to Surge.sh and point server calls to server's APIs
#### Server
- [x] Connect to GDAX sandboxes for development and production environment 
- [x] Handle security based on GDAX/Coinbase account
- [x] Listen to changes on crypto-currencies
- [x] Hold feeds in a local data structure
- [ ] Define `Rule` class
- [ ] Fetch user account info from GDAX
- [ ] Fetch user `rules` from database
- [ ] Enable Buy/Sell, Taker/Maker actions based
- [ ] Perform transactions based on `rules`
- [ ] Store transactions in database

## Docs
### 3rd Party APIs
- Stocks feed: [IEX Trading](https://iextrading.com/developer/)
- Stocks order management(in the near future...): [Robinhood's Private API](https://api.robinhood.com/)
- Crypto-currencies feed and order management: [GDAX Websocket Client](https://github.com/coinbase/gdax-node#websocket-client)
### Rules
I define a `Rule` as a single instance of multiple trading strategies to be used by the `Engine`. Rules can be defined by the user and will be stored in the Mongo instance
######Attributes // TODO
## Additional thoughts:
- Create both Desktop and Web versions and share the code as much as possible
- Enable the user to select what currency to watch
- Enable user settings in general including the above mentioned and also rules created and current rules used
- Enable notifications by email or text messages. Also use the native notifications API in the browser
